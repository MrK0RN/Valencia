                        <p>Before any deposit we run full checks: property registry, IBI and utility debts, technical docs, encumbrances or mortgages.</p>

                        <p>We run the deal remotely via power of attorney. We’ve had cases where clients saw the home for the first time when receiving the keys.</p>
